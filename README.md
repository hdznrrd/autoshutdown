autoshutdown
============

A simple shellscript to shut down a machine once a set of monitored machines is no longer reachable.

I've written this for a home fileserver that's woken up using wakeup-on-lan and automatically shuts down 15 minutes after the last known machine on the network isn't reachable anymore (ie. everyone went to bed).
